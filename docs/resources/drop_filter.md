# Drop Filter Provider

Provides a Logz.io drop filter resource. This can be used to create and manage Logz.io drop filters.

* Learn more about drop filters in the [Logz.io Docs](https://docs.logz.io/api/#tag/Drop-filters).

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "api_token" {
  type = string
  description = "your logzio API token"
}

provider "logzio" {
  api_token = var.api_token
}

resource "logzio_drop_filter" "test_filter" {
  log_type = "some_type"

  field_conditions {
    field_name = "some_field"
    value = "string_value"
  }
  field_conditions {
    field_name = "other_field_int"
    value = 200
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

**Note:** Except the `active` argument, changing an argument value _after creation_ will cause the **entire resource** to be destroyed and re-created.

### Required:

* `field_conditions` - (Block list) Filters for an exact match of a field:value pair. **Note** that changing this field after creation will cause the resource to be destroyed and re-created. See below for **nested schema**.

### Optional:

* `log_type` - (String) Filters for the [log type](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/built-in-log-types.html). Omit or leave empty if you want this filter to apply to all types. **Note** that changing this field after creation will cause the resource to be destroyed and re-created. 
* `active` - (Boolean) If true, the drop filter is active and logs that match the filter are dropped before indexing. If false, the drop filter is disabled. **Note** this argument can only be changed after the creation of the filter. Each filter is created with the `active` argument set to true.

#### Nested schema for `field_conditions`:

* `field_name` - (String) Exact field name in your Kibana mapping for the selected `log_type`. **Note** that changing this field after creation will cause the resource to be destroyed and re-created.
* `value` - (Object) Exact field value. The filter looks for an exact value match of the entire object. **Note** that changing this field after creation will cause the resource to be destroyed and re-created.

##  Attribute Reference

* `drop_filter_id` - (String) Drop filter ID in the Logz.io database.

### Import drop filter as resource

You can import drop filters as follows:
